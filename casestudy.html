            <h1> Case Study - My Movies App </h1>
            <p> Using the Javascript development of the MERN (MongoDB, Express,
                React, Node.js) stack, I created an application allows users to
                view information about different movies including the details on
                the genre and director. They are also able to update their own
                personal information and can create their own list of favourite
                movies from the selection given. The goal by the end was to
                ensure the following features of the app were implemented
                successfully:

            <h1>WHAT WENT WELL:</h1>
            <p> My strengths in this project occurred with building the foundation of the app.  I was successful in storing and retrieving data and creating separate components and pages to ensure individual focus on each function including user registration and log in, movie and profile viewing, and updating profiles.  Presentation and documentation of coding is important when having to navigate in between scripts and finding bugs.</p>

                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                    <li>Organized all coding to make it easily readable, with notes provided to track the functions of each code</li>
                    <li>Consistency in collecting movie database and updating where necessary</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Created a REST API using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js</li>

                </ul>

                    <li>Remain consistent with each technique</li>
                </ul>
            <h1>WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL:</h1>
            <p> The greatest challenge in this project came down to testing the business logic layer of the app – ensuring that it could recognize a registered user and allow the user to log in and make updates.  My statements and queries were not being read and as a result, the data appeared null. This obstacle reappeared when it came to client-side app routing.  Some of my functions were not properly defined, making it difficult to call data between the components, API, and the front end.</p>

                </ul>
            <h1>WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED:</h1>
            <p> I need to ensure that all my data, functions, endpoints, and routes consistently align between the front, middle, and back end of the app.  Even the smallest of errors such as inconsistent capitalization on a property can prevent the app from being displayed properly.  Having a consistent workflow and visual strategic map will help me resolve bugs more efficiently.</p>

            <h1>CAREER CHANGE STRATEGY:</h1>
                <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                    <li>Revisit the app frequently in order to make enhancements to maintain and improve my skills in full stack Javascript development</li>
